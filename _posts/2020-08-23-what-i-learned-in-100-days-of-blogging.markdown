### Why did I do it?

Like most people stuck inside their homes during this quarantine, I also decided to pick up new activities. From changing the oil in my car to cooking at home, most were successful. I wanted to add something that would also increase my habit of reading and writing. I ended up making a challenge for myself. I wanted to do 100 blog posts in 100 days! Not two weeks, not 30 days but a 100.

Not only did writing every day made sure I formed a habit, but it also allowed me to share what I know with other developers. I also got better at the art of writing itself. Better grammar, less spelling checks and improved delivery are some of the benefits. I consider it a win-win situation.

In this process, I learned a few new topics, researched further on topics I already knew and overall improved my skillset.

### Where

I decided to start a blog on the domain I already own: https://bhagat.me. It's a site I have used for a while to host my resume. Please go check it out! The blog is hosted on https://bhagat.me/blog.

I used GitHub pages and Jekyll to create a static blog. The theme for my blog is `minima` (one of the most common and minimal Jekyll themes out there). `jekyll-sitemap` is used as a plugin to auto-generate a sitemap for Google Search Console. Here's a preview:

I do collect analytics data using Google Analytics, but no personally-identifying information is collected on the blog. I'm mostly interested in visitor count and the geographical user spread.

Halfway through writing on my site, I decided also to sync the blog to https://dev.to. DEV is a community of software developers that promotes collaboration and networked learning. Imagine it as an open-source and free Medium. The sync happened to add exposure to what the blog showcased. I also wanted to reach out to a broader audience. You can check out my dev.to profile at https://dev.to/bhagatparwinder.

### What

I've worked with JavaScript for the last 15 years, so JS blogging was an obvious choice. I knew I could quickly come up with 100 post topics for JS. I was so wrong! The blog covers so many different aspects of JavaScript. From popular topics like closures, async-await, arrow functions and ES6-ES11 to lesser know tips and tricks like the empty statement, eval and generators. By the end of it, however, I was running out of ideas to write about (if I only considered JS). I went exploring.

My blog covers four different series now:

1. JavaScript
2. RxJS
3. Problem Solving
4. Productivity

Even though I have not tagged posts on my blog, they are tagged when I upload them to https://dev.to.

### How

I use Markdown to write my site. Markdown has been my go-to language for notes, presentations, static web pages and this blog. I've been writing with Markdown for as long as I can recall. My editor of choice is Visual Studio Code. I did write three posts about my editor detailing [extensions](https://bhagat.me/blog/2020/06/28/top-10-vscode-extensions.html), [setting](https://bhagat.me/blog/2020/07/11/top-10-vs-code-settings.html) and why I prefer [VS Code](https://bhagat.me/blog/2020/06/17/code-editor-visual-studio-code.html).

The editor has been configured to aid my writing (high contrast theme, extensions to add Markdown support and an emmet template).

I use Canva (https://www.canva.com) for social images. They are fantastic even with a free tier.
