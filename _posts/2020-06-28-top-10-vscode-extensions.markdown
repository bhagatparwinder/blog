Today, I am going to take a slight break from writing about JavaScript and re-visit my favorite editor, Visual Studio Code or VS Code. We are going to go over my top 10 extensions.

## [Andromeda](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EliverLara.andromeda)

Andromeda is technically not an extension but a theme for VS Code. I do not change themes every day. I spent a lot of time hunting for the theme that I like and this is what I settled on. Great readability. The theme works great with fonts like Operator Mono or Catograph Mono.

If you are not planning to shell out too much money for Operator Mono, I would suggest getting [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh/) (my font of choice at the moment).

## [Auto Close Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tag)

Automatically add HTML/XML close tag, same as Visual Studio IDE or Sublime Text does. From VS Code 1.16, it has built-in close tag support for HTML, Handlebars and Razor files. This extension adds auto closing to other languages like XML, PHP, Vue, JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, TSX and so on.
