Today, I am going to take a slight break from writing about JavaScript and re-visit my favorite editor, Visual Studio Code or VS Code. We are going to go over my top 10 extensions.

## [Andromeda](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EliverLara.andromeda)

Andromeda is technically not an extension but a theme for VS Code. I do not change themes every day. I spent a lot of time hunting for the theme that I like and this is what I settled on. Great readability. The theme works great with fonts like Operator Mono or Catograph Mono.

If you are not planning to shell out too much money for Operator Mono, I would suggest getting [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh/) (my font of choice at the moment).

## [Auto Close Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tag)

Automatically add HTML/XML close tag, same as Visual Studio IDE or Sublime Text does. From VS Code 1.16, it has built-in close tag support for HTML, Handlebars and Razor files. This extension adds auto closing to other languages like XML, PHP, Vue, JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, TSX and so on.

## [Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag)

Automatically rename paired HTML/XML tag, same as Visual Studio IDE does. With this extension, when you rename one HTML/XML tag, automatically rename the paired HTML/XML tag.

## [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)

If you work with Markdown as much as I do (like writing this blog), this is a must have. All you need for Markdown (keyboard shortcuts, table of contents, auto preview and more).

Major features I ❤️

1. Keyboard shortcuts to stylize text
2. Adding table of contents and automatically updating it
3. Printing Markdown to HTML

## [Output Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBM.output-colorizer)

Language extension for VSCode that adds syntax colorization for both the output/debug/extensions panel and `*.log` files. Makes reading those logs easy on the eye. Works with almost any theme out there.
