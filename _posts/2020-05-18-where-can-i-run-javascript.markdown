I almost missed writing the blog post today. It rained a ton yesterday, causing the basement to flood, and it took a significant portion of the day cleaning that mess up (excuses!). Day 3 of my commitment, and it was going to fail ðŸ˜†.

Now that you know what JavaScript is and how awesome it can be, the question comes, where do I run it or work with it?

There are 4 key places where **I** run JavaScript daily:

1. **The browser console**:
   A browser's console is the easiest method for anyone trying to run JavaScript. Almost all browsers have developer tools that include a console to run scripts. Since most of us have access to a browser, this is the most convenient way of testing the waters.

    If you would like to know how to get to the console in the browser of your choice, [check this handy guide out](https://support.monday.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002197259-How-to-Open-the-Developer-Console-in-your-Browser)

2. **Using your terminal**:
    Yes! The terminal. Install node, and it provides you with a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) interface

    Instruction on how to install NodeJS can be [found here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

3. **In an online sandbox**:
    There are a ton of online websites that provide you with a playground or sandbox to run your JavaScript code. Try them out! Here are some of my favorites: [PlayCode](https://playcode.io), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net), [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) and [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com)

4. **Code editor**:
   If you do not have a code editor installed, you should. There are paid offerings like IntelliJ and WebStorm from JetBrains, but there are free options that will do just fine. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) are the top two free code editors that I recommend.

   If you decided to install VSCode, there is an excellent plugin for it that lets you run JavaScript as you write the code (live feedback). [Check out Quokka](https://quokkajs.com/) and get [the plugin here](https://quokkajs.com/docs/#getting-started)
